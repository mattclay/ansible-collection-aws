# Ansible Collection - mattclay.aws

AWS modules and plugins useful for publishing AWS Lambda functions and deploying to AWS API Gateway.

These modules and plugins were originally extracted from the [AWS Terminator](https://github.com/mattclay/aws-terminator) project.

Since they were originally designed for deployment of the AWS Terminator there are portions of the modules which are incomplete and/or untested.
